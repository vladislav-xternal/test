# What It Does
The Python Text Generator is a powerful tool designed to create coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input prompts you provide. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to generate creative writing, articles, dialogue, or even poetry. Whether you're looking for inspiration, need assistance with brainstorming ideas, or want to automate content generation, this text generator is here to help!

# How to Run It
To run the Python Text Generator, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You may also need to install necessary libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Download the Script**: Clone or download the repository containing the text generator script.
3. **Run the Script**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. **Input Your Prompt**: Once the script is running, enter your authentication key that you can get from *https://app.edenai.run/bricks/catalog* (the link on the website is included in the script too), then enter your text prompt. The generator will then produce output based on your input.
